# intro-to-python
The materials in this repository are for an Intro to Python workshop hosted by the [Emory Center for Digital Scholarship](https://digitalscholarship.emory.edu/).

The workshop tutorial is composed in a Jupyter notebook `workshop.ipynb`. We recommend using [Google Colabs](colab.research.google.com) to open the notebook. In Colabs, click on File>>Open Notebook, select "GitHub" and then enter the following URL: [https://github.com/ecds/intro-to-python/blob/main/workshop.ipynb](https://github.com/ecds/intro-to-python/blob/main/workshop.ipynb).

The notebook draws on the dataset `MetObjects1000.csv` which is a subset of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's [public dataset](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess) listing objects in the collections.
